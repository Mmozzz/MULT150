1. Easy:It's a simple game with simple Mechanics. You only have to dodge one obstacle at a time.
   Hard:The movement isn’t the best, and it's hard to know if you lined up with the powerup when you're on the sides. 
2. Add more than one obstacle at a time. Adding more movement to the character.
3. Make the environment look better and add obstacles that you would need to slide under or jump over. 
4. Trying to get a high time and trying to avoid as many obstacles as possible.
5. Lining up the powerups and being slowed down when you get hit since it just doesn’t feel like a smooth transition. 

 Changes:
1. Made the obstacles bigger and made to look like the lazers on the side.
2. Changed the Powerups shape, glows more, and added a rainbow effect for the particles.
